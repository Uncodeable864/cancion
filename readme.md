## About Canción

Canción is a CLI interface that takes any MIDI file and will play it, similar to "concert magic" modes on some pianos. It plays note by note.

## Features

Canción allows you to play in 2 modes:

1. Timed Play: Plays any MIDI file any tempo, with ever touching the keyboard
1. Note-by-Note Play: Maps each note on the MIDI file to each note on the piano.

It even allows you to select your MIDI chanel of choice.
